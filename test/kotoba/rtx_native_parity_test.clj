(ns kotoba.rtx-native-parity-test
  "Parity gate between `src/kotoba/rtx_native.kotoba` (the semantic authority) and
  `src/kotoba/rtx_native.cljc` (the load path a Clojure/ClojureScript consumer
  requires).

  Shape follows `kotoba-lang/css` (`css.kotoba-parity-test`), `kotoba-lang/dsl-core`
  and `kotoba-lang/async` (ADR-2608130900), and `kotoba-lang/postfx` (ADR-2608133600):
  the `.kotoba` is compiled here and executed through the reference evaluator in this
  same JVM, so nothing crosses a runtime boundary, and `kotoba-lang/compiler` stays a
  test-only dependency.

  WHY THE .cljc EXISTS AT ALL. `c5e3c158` (2026-07-20) deleted
  `src/kotoba/rtx_native.cljc` and put the `.kotoba` at that path. A `.kotoba` is on no
  Clojure classpath, so `kotoba.rtx-native` stopped being loadable by every runtime
  this workspace ranks above the native path. The `.cljc` restored beside it is the
  load path; the `.kotoba` remains the authority.

  SEMANTICS DECISION: VERBATIM. Every value the guest exports is byte-identical to
  the corresponding value in the pre-migration `.cljc`, and `activated?` is `false` on
  both sides, so the restored file is the pre-migration file unchanged (`c5e3c158^`).
  Unlike `dsl-core`/`async`, the guest did not alter meaning here; this test is what
  makes \"unchanged\" a checked claim.

  WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM — the divergences, asserted rather than hidden.

  1. `def` vs nullary function. Kotoba has no top-level value bindings, so every
     constant crosses as a nullary export. Value is compared; the binding form is not.
     `activated?` is the one export that is a function on BOTH sides, so it is the one
     place where the comparison is like-for-like.

  2. THE GUEST HAS NO VECTOR. `nv-compat-targets` is a Clojure vector; the migration
     flattened it into `nv-compat-primary` / `nv-compat-secondary`, because this
     guest's ABI carries `:string` and not a sequence.
     `nv-compat-targets-is-exactly-the-two-positional-guest-exports` compares element
     by element AND pins the length, so a third element cannot be added without a
     guest export behind it — but the *sequence itself* has no counterpart, and that
     is stated here rather than passed over.

  3. `main` is a wasm entry point, not library API, and is not mirrored."
